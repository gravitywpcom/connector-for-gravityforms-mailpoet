# This snippet is adapted from graphql-api-for-wp.
#
# GitHub Action: whenever creating a new release of the source code,
# also create a release of the installable plugin.
# Steps to execute:
# - Checkout the source code
# - Create a .zip file, excluding:
#   - All hidden files (.git, .gitignore, etc)
#   - All development files, ending in .dist
#   - All composer files <= after installing dependencies, no need for them anymore
#   - Markdown files concerning development
#   - Folder build/ <= created only to store the .zip file
#   - Folder tests/ <= not needed for the plugin
# - Upload the .zip file as an artifact to the action (this step is possibly optional)
# - Upload the .zip file as a release, for download
